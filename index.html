		"Data Science" is more than a buzzword, or a re-dressing of existing ideas from statistics and computer science; it's an extremely useful way of looking at the research process from the perspective of the data pipeline. In this class we will be examining the Data Science process from the perspective of social science research.

	      <h2 class="title">Course Objectives:</h2>
	      <div class="entry">
	      <ol>
		<li>Outline the Data Science process in terms of tasks to accomplish and the tools we will use to make them work.</li>
		<li>Effectively construct analysis-ready data sets that are portable and appropriately annotated.
		<li>Analyze data through statistical and graphical means.
		<li>Effectively use R, a widely-used statistical package, to perform analyses, integrated with other software packages.</li>
	      </ol>
	      We will combine the lecture- and lab-styles in this class. Students are expected to bring their laptop computers to every class and spend some of this class time working on the homework assignments in groups.

	      <h2 class="title">Course Work:</h2>
	      <div class="entry">
		Initial plan for the course work required in this class (subject to modification:)
		<ul>
		  <li>Readings: There will be a reading assignment each week. You are expected to ask two questions about the material relating to the data, the method, the software or the replication.
		  <li>In-class exercises: We will periodically use the time in class to carry out lab-like exercises in groups. These will not be graded explicitly but will function as lead-ins to the homework assignments.</li>
		  <li>Homeworks: There will be a series of homework assignments issued throughout the course to test the skills we learn each week. Each will build on the readings and in-class exercises. You are expected to and are encouraged to revise your assignments after the initial submission in order to improve your scores.</li>
		  <li>Projects: Homework assignments will be integrated into a larger scale project setting. Final achievement across each homework assignment will result in a stronger  </li>
		</ul>

	    </div>

	    <div class="post">
	      <h2 class="title">Grading Policy</h2>
	      <div class="entry">
		You are encouraged to discuss homework problems with your fellow students; however, the work you submit must be your own. You must acknowledge any help received on your assignments or labs. Copied work will receive no credit and prompt notification to university authorities. Please come talk to me if there are difficulties; problems/conflicts must be discussed <b>with at least 48 hours notice</b> before a deadline.

		Each homework assignment will work in the following manner:
		<ul>
		  <li>1 point will be given for an assignment turned in by the deadline, with all parts completed in good faith. This does not have to be perfect, but it must be complete.</li>
		  <li>1 point will be given for an assignment with "perfect" results -- that is, all the charts presented are correctly prepared, all labels properly attached, all numerical answers are correct, and so forth.</li>
		  <li>1 point will be given for an assignment with "perfect" code -- that is, properly commented code blocks so that another can replicate your efforts, and text answers prepared in full to support your outputs.</li>
		  <li>You may re-submit your assignment up to two times within 4 weeks of it being returned for re-consideration of the "perfect" points.</li>
		</ul>

		In this way, late assignments will be accepted but will only be eligible for 2 of the 3 total points (for a perfect assignment).<br>

		The total number of points that can be awarded in the course is 12*3[homeworks] + 4[classroom] = 40. Final letter grades will be determined directly with this point scheme:

	      <h2 class="title">Final Project Deliverables Guide</h2>
	      <div class="entry">

		<p>The bulk of the project was covered in Homeworks 8, 9 and 10 (in Lectures 10-12). A reminder that the general expectation of the project is replication: How would you show someone else how to replicate the work you’ve done? Recall the specific research question: Do the emotional and subjective qualifications of the tweets of “die-hard” fans of a college team correlate to the team’s performance in college football games – either before or after the game is played?</p>

		<p>This performance includes: winning the game, winning by 7 or more points, losing by 7 or more points, and exceeding or beating the spread.</p>

		<p>Specific project deliverables:</p>

		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
		  <li><strong>Long Form</strong> – in the style of the homeworks: a document detailing the full creation of the project.</li>
		<ul>
		  <li><p>How you obtained and saved the data of interest for your project. This includes code blocks that do not need to be run directly when you knit (that is, you should use the <code>eval=FALSE</code> option), especially if you are saving the data locally. For the data you copied directly from online, you should make it clear what the original source was for anyone else who might be interested in repeating the process.</p></li>

		  <li><p>How you processed the data into what you needed to perform your analyses. Regular expression matching, table joins, explicit inclusion from other sources. This should include a description of all the data you’ve assembled and how you made exceptions for data that did not make sense. What would someone doing this project again expect to see?</p></li>

		  <li><p>The actual analyses you’ve conducted. This can include the logistic model you were asked for but can also include simple statistical comparisons, graphical summaries and anything else you hope will clarify the analysis and its results.</p></li>

		  <li><p>The conclusions you’ve drawn from the data you’ve put together: positive, negative and null.</p></li>

		</ul>
		</ol> 
		<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
		  <li><p><strong>Executive Summary</strong> document. This should be no longer than 3 printed pages long and should contain no visible code, only what you need to describe the work you’ve done to anyone interested in the research. Graphics would be helpful here to illustrate the points you’ve made. This will be what you present in class on December 7.</p></li>
		  <li><p>The supplemental data files you have created to answer these questions.</p></li>
